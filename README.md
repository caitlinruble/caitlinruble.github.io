My recent data science and analytics projects:

## Project 1: [Global Solar Analysis Tableau Dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/caitlin.ortega.ruble/viz/GlobalSolarAnalysis/GlobalDashboard?publish=yes)
A project which overlays global solar power generation capacity data on a background map which shows photovoltaic power potential. The dashboard is intended to be used as a tool for solar businesses assessing international market potential based on where solar power is and isn't being used along with which locations have the greatest potential.
